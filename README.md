# Basic Dungeon Game

## The scariest game you've played since...
#### Actually, it's not that scary

## What is the Dungeon Game?

The Dungeon Game is a basic game in which a monster and a secret escape door are
randomly placed in a grid. The **X** represents you position on the grid.

Your goal is to find the hidden door without running into the monster!

As of now, the game does not support movements with your keyboard so you'll have
to type ("up", "down", "left", "right") the direction where you want your player
to move.

To quit the game, simply type "quit". Thanks guys, hope you enjoy.

I've recently started to learn Python and this is the result of a tutorial to
create a basic game. If you aren't super familiar with Python but want to play
this game:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer
    1. Check this link to find out how:
    [Google Edu Document](https://edu.google.com/openonline/course-builder/docs/1.10/set-up-course-builder/check-for-python.html)
2. Save the **dungeon_game.py** file to whatever location you want
3. Run the file
    1. See how to run a python file: [pythoncentral.io](http://pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/)
